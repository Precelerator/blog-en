There are so many of these that I can't list them all, but you can find a nice overview on this site: <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/tools/prototyping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://uxtools.co/tools/prototyping</a></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Marvel</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://marvelapp.com/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">UXPin</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.uxpin.com/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Proto.io</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://proto.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://proto.io/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Protopie</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.protopie.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.protopie.io/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Axure</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.axure.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.axure.com/</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>No-Code App Builders</h3>\n<p>These are similiar to web site builders like Wix, Weebly, Webflow etc., only that instead of sites you can build out fully functioning apps. This can be great for simple apps that only store and display data, but since you're \"programming\" using the visual editor of the app builder, you can quickly run into limitations of the builder itself. It's worth to take a look into the app examples advertised by the app builders to get a better feeling of what they can (and can't do) in terms of features. I'd encourage you to think through your ideal app first so that you don't end up sacrificing your initial vision by staying within the boundaries of what these no-code app builders can offer.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 150px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\">Glideapps</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\"><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.glideapps.com/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\">Adalo</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\"><a href=\"https://www.adalo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.adalo.com/</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\">Bubble.io</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 50px;\"><a href=\"https://bubble.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bubble.io/</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>3D-Design</h3>\n<p>This is a bit of a niche, but depending on the product this can be a very impressive demonstration and allow for a whole new understanding of a product through a 3D representation.

Fortunately, there are resources and tools that make it easy to create a landing page for your project or start-up. This blog post collects the most popular website builders, with which you can quickly and easily launch your own landing page.</div>\n\n<h4>Drag&amp;Drop Website-Builder</h4>\n<p>Modern website builders do not require any code at all. They allow you to hack together your own pages by using visual drag and drop editors without any programming. Such tools often offer ready-made templates into which users can insert their own content. Well-known players in this market are Carrd, Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress and Webflow, some of which will be briefly compared below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://carrd.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carrd</a>: Carrd is particularly suitable for one-pager, i.e. landing pages or similar, which are not too complex. Carrd does not require any programming knowledge and offers a variety of <a href=\"https://carrd.co/build\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">templates</a> which can serve as a starting point. Carrd offers a free plan as well as a very affordable pro-plan.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Pros: fair pricing, Free-Plan in order to try out (indefinitely), well-crafted templates</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">Cons: mainly useful for one-pagers (not blogs etc.), limited adaptability of templates</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://de.wix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wix</a>: Often belittled as the \"McDonalds of website builders\", Wix promises an easy creation process for your own website. Wix is primarily aimed at people without any programming experience and abstracts any implementation details away through its visual editor. Pages can be hacked together via Wix' drag &amp; drop builder. As often the case with other website builders, Wix pages cannot be exported as code. As a result, owners of Wix pages have to pay a monthly subscription fee to Wix in order to edit their pages. Wix offers numerous plugins to add features to pages and provides templates and a custom logo maker.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Pros: simple editor, aimed at people without an IT background, easy entry bar</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">Cons: dependence on Wix, after initial selection it is difficult to switch between templates, sites not always mobile-friendly, SEO of sites below average</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weebly.com/de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weebly</a>/ <a href=\"https://de.godaddy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GoDaddy</a>: comparable to Wix.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://de.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace</a>: Squarespace is another player in the website builder market. Squarespace main selling point are its professional templates which are designed by Squarespace itself and qualitatively stand out from the competition. Squarespace focuses on minimalist but high-quality design, all templates are mobile-friendly from the start. Squarespace offers detailed guides and resources and additionally provides live chat support.</p>\n<p class=\"msg--success msg\">Pros: high-quality templates, ability to export code, ability to change themes</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">Cons: no dedicated free-plan, only try-out phase, more pricey than alternatives, limited editing capabilities of templates</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://de.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wordpress</a>: Originally started as a blogging platform, Wordpress now operates a significant proportion of all websites worldwide. With a very user-friendly process for content creation and an extensive plugin system, Wordpress has a low entry threshold, but still countless customization options. Wordpress has a large number of ready-made free and paid themes and its popular page-builder <a href=\"https://elementor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elementor</a>. The only downsides of Wordpress are its speed (often sluggish depending on hosting and number of plugins) and security gaps caused by outdated or amateurishly implemented plugins.</p>\n<p class=\"msg--success msg\">Pros: Widespread, large community, many useful templates</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">Cons: can be quite slow, plugins must be updated</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Webflow</a>: Calling itself the \"Design Tool of the future\", Webflow offers enormously extensive configuration and design adaptations. It is a browser-based website builder with a large variety of templates. Webflow is especially suitable for people who already have some website experience, as many concepts from website programming can also be found in the visual Webflow editor.

The low barriers of entry (free for personal use, web-based, easy to create and share prototypes) make Figma ideal for projects of all types involving the design of digital applications (apps, websites, etc.). Figma eliminates the need for traditional mockup/wireframe tools by quickly creating realistic interfaces with a visual editor that look very similar to \"real\" applications.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>To get a first impression of Figma's approach, it is worth taking a look at the following teaser (1:35):</div>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/365881491?color=5551ff\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></figure>\n<h4>Figma: Getting Started</h4>\n<p>In order to get started with Figma, head over to  <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.figma.com/</a> and create your account. Students and educators get benefits when signing up for Figma: using your university email adress you're able to obtain the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/education/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Figma Education</a> plan (unlimited projects and unlimited editors for up to two years) if you apply or register using <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/education/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p>Since Figma is web-based, you will be taken directly to the application, where after some setup questions a short introduction is waiting for you:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/Figma-Intro.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-xs.png 300w ,https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-sm.png 480w ,https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-md.png 768w ,https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-xl.png 1200w ,https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-xxl.png 1600w ,https://precelerator.github.io/blog-en/media/posts/4/responsive/Figma-Intro-xxxl.png 2560w\"  alt=\"Figma Intro\" width=\"554\" height=\"322\"></figure>\n<p>If you prefer to work with the desktop app, you can find it in the web app via the menu -&gt; \"Download desktop app\". For inspiration, it is worth taking a look at the example projects found in the \"Recent\" tab of the desktop app in the menu (\"Prototyping in Figma\", \"Figma Basics\", \"Wireframing in Figma\").</p>\n<p>In order to collaborate with your team, <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039481034-Invite-a-Viewer-or-Editor-to-a-team#Invite_an_Editor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invite other students</a> to your project. For more information on how Figma allows for collaborative editing and commenting, check out their <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collaboration page!</a></p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<div>Even in the Free Plan, Figma allows you to invite project members to join projects and collaborate with them. A key feature of Figma is the ability to work together on a design project, regardless of the operating system. This allows all stakeholders to edit and comment on the project in order to develop a design together as a team.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Created designs can be made available to others as a clickable prototype via the \"Share\" feature and can be tried out via a shareable link or even mobile via the \"Figma Mirror\" app.</div>\n<div>\n<p>Figma offers a lot of advanced features that allow for a better structure for larger projects and that can be highly beneficial for a more efficient workflow within Figma. I'd recommend taking a look at the relevant tutorials and in-depth Office Hours that Figma has on their Youtube channel.

Especially for Figma beginners, you can find some quickstart templates here, which can also be used as inspiration for your own projects.</p>\n<h4>Resume</h4>\n<p>Figma impresses with a generous free plan, collaboration possibilities for teams, demonstrability through divisible links and a very active community that provides sample resources and tutorials on a large scale. With Figma, you can quickly develop clickable prototypes that look surprisingly close to finished applications, making it the tool of choice for all those that want a presentable demo of their idea without writing a line of code.</p>\n<p>It's easy to get started with, and with it's vibrant community there are tons of guides and resources out there that can serve as a quick starting point for your and your application.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Are you working on your own prototype and would like some guidance around your design- or prototyping project?

            "content_html": "<div>Spreadsheet software such as Excel and Google Sheets is an essential tool for data collection in a large number of projects, but spreadsheets are often not easy to grasp and tend to be difficult to use on mobile. At the same time, spreadsheets are the most common source of data in all kinds of imaginable projects which is a source of frequent annoyance.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This is exactly the use case that the American startup Glide addresses and promises the automatic generation of mobile-capable web apps straight out of Google Sheets. Programming knowledge is not necessary and everything you need is provided by Glide. Examples of Glide apps can be found in the extensive<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/templates\">template gallery</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which contains demo apps for different use cases (e.g. a conference timetable, a CRM or a task tracker).</span></div>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technical Implementation<br><br></span></h4>\n<div>Glide uses Google Sheets to store the app's data and generates a so-called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">progressive web app</a> for the user, ultimately nothing more than a mobile web application that smartphone users can install on their home screen. This saves Glide the detour via the respective App Stores, instead Glide can generate a URL which users can use to install the created app. Due to the availability via a link and the execution in the browser, Glide apps run automatically on any mobile device regardless of the operating system (Android, iOS, etc.). After clicking on the respective link, the user is prompted to add the app to the home screen of his smartphone. The trick: since Progressive Web Apps are web applications so the app does not need any storage space (since unlike native apps, it runs directly in the user's browser).</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>A visual editor allows Glide users to customize the look and feel of the app, so that the display and positioning of content can be adjusted as desired. Data can be manipulated in the associated spreadsheet which means that adding, editing and deleting entries can be done within Google Sheets.</div>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glide offers different </span><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/pricing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing-Plans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Personal Plan with Glide logo and some restrictions (&lt;500 records, &lt;1000 edits per month, &lt;100 MB storage space for pictures etc.) is provided free of charge. Professional apps without branding and with additional features such as upstream authentication, a dedicated domain, up to 25000 records, 10 GB of memory and unlimited edits are available for around 30€ per month.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resume</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, Glide provides an impressive feature set for no-code apps, and with Google Sheets as the primary data storage and Glide's visual app editor, it is especially suited for users who have no programming experience. Due to the technical implementation as a progressive web app, Glide apps are very easy to divide and install, so as a result a presentable application can be created with just a few hours of work. Due to the Glide branding, the free plan is only suitable for more professional projects to a limited extent, but with 30€ per month, the pricing for pro apps is low compared to self-implementation or commissioning a developer with the app development. Glide positions itself prominently in the area of simple list-based apps, but with features such as the display of content such as images or maps, it also offers content that goes beyond pure lists. Whether Glide is a sensible choice definitely depends on the type of application, so it is worth taking a look at the </span><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/templates\">sample applications</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to get a better feel for the features and limitations of Glide.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Call To Action</h3>\n<div>Are you interested in launching your own project and have questions or need support?
